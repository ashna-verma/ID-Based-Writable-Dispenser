# ID-Based-Writable-Dispenser
-Workplace theft is motivated by a variety of factors, including
difficult economic conditions, rejection of raises and promotions, worry about layoffs, and resentment toward
employers. The goal of a theft-prevention approach should be to create a moral environment through
transparent policies and procedures that are regularly followed. PenPal is a complete stationery management
system for non-returnable items, not just a system that will dispense pens and other items. The objective is to
create a system that can not only distribute these stationery items quickly and save time, but also measure how
many items are taken by the employees at what time of day or on what date, as well as aid in identifying any
employees who may be abusing the office stationery.
-The architecture of an IoT
based smart non-returnable stationary dispensing
system is proposed which is able to dispense the stationary items
whenever the user operating it taps his office RFID
card on it, and then selects whatever he wants, which
gets dispensed. The details of the transaction are sent
to the server and to be stored in a database. The
dispensing system is a spiral ring attached stepper
motor based system which dispenses the item.
